# Tema Selecto: Multicommodity Flows + Reinforcement Learning

Repository for experiments of Tema Selecto's paper I Semester 2020. Trying to solve a distribution problem with Reinforcement 
Learning by simulating distribution environments with min cost flows.

Current status is experiments are inconclusive, the generator is probably bugged. This repo will be forked and refactored
for thesis work.
